# FW-0050 — Multi-party submission: design proposal

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** PROPOSAL (not ratified). Owner pushback expected during review; framing decisions Q1–Q4 are open until accepted.
**Row:** [FW-0050 in `PLANNING.md:574`](../../PLANNING.md) (design); paired build row [FW-0061 in `PLANNING.md:689`](../../PLANNING.md).
**Journey:** [J-041 in `JOURNEYS.md:703`](../../JOURNEYS.md).
**Feature key:** `multiParty` per [web ADR-0011 Feature Ownership Table line 138](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md).
**Source brief:** [`thoughts/sketches/2026-05-23-fw-0050-multi-party-research-brief.md`](../sketches/2026-05-23-fw-0050-multi-party-research-brief.md). Upstream-primitive inventory, FW interactions, and scenario boundary questions live there; this doc decides over them.

## 1. Goal and non-goals

### 1.1 Goal

Decide the formspec-web shape for joint-submission flows where each party authenticates independently, holds their own draft, sees only the parts the form's privacy model says they should see, and signs their own attestations cryptographically separately ([FW-0050 Done](../../PLANNING.md)). The deliverables are: framing decisions (Q1–Q4), the `multiParty` capability contract under [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md), the port shape (or the explicit decision not to add one), the cross-stack dependency chain, and the open questions that remain for the build row.

This is a **design row**. The deliverable is a doc plus follow-on cross-stack and spec items, not code. The build row is [FW-0061 in `PLANNING.md:689`](../../PLANNING.md).

### 1.2 Non-goals

- **Implementation.** No code, no port-conformance fixtures, no React shell. FW-0061 owns build.
- **Authoring the upstream spec.** Per [web ADR-0004](../adr/0004-cross-repo-placement-consume-not-invent.md), formspec-web consumes upstream primitives, does not invent them. This doc proposes XS-1 content from the consumer perspective but does not author the stack-root ADR or the formspec schema change.
- **Synchronous co-fill.** Real-time co-presence editing is out of scope here per Q2; if pulled forward, it lands as its own design row, not as scope creep on FW-0061.
- **Studio-side multi-actor editing.** That is the authoring-time problem solved by [stack-root ADR-0151 (multi-actor editing via Automerge)](../../../thoughts/adr/0151-multi-actor-editing-automerge.md). Respondent-time multi-party submission is a structurally different problem (N principals, each with their own signed attestation, not N authors converging on one document). Do not import Automerge framing.
- **AI-agent party.** EXT-3 carves the AI-agent variant out via `agentChain` (deferred per [FW-0058 in `PLANNING.md:659`](../../PLANNING.md)); this doc treats an AI-agent party as a future extension along the same role taxonomy, not as a separate shape.
- **Cross-IdP federation specifics.** Per-party identity proofing across IdPs is a real concern (research brief Q6) but lands through [FW-0030 federated identity claim handoff](../../PLANNING.md). This design declares the dependency; it does not solve it.

## 2. Framing decisions (Q1–Q4)

Each decision: the answer first, then the rationale, then the alternative considered and why rejected. All four are PROPOSALS pending owner review.

### 2.1 Q1 — One canonical multi-party shape with a role taxonomy

**PROPOSAL.** FW-0050 designs **one parameterized shape** with a closed `partyRole` taxonomy: `coEqual`, `asymmetricPrimary`, `asymmetricSecondary`, `guardianFor`. Joint tax (two `coEqual`), immigration sponsorship (`asymmetricPrimary` petitioner + `asymmetricSecondary` beneficiary), child custody (two `coEqual` parents over a non-party child subject), household benefits (see disposition rule below) all fall out as configurations — once the multi-party-vs-FW-0037 boundary is decided per scenario.

**Multi-party-vs-FW-0037 disposition rule (closes research brief §3.4 boundary question).** A flow is **multi-party (FW-0050-shaped) iff exhibit-signers have their own session continuity** — separate identity binding through `IdentityProvider`, separate `DraftStore` scope, separate signature ceremony with its own `signedPayload.digest`. Otherwise it is **single-party-with-exhibits (FW-0037-shaped)**: the principal's session is the only session, the principal's signature is the only `AuthoredSignature` with `capacity = "self"`, and exhibit-signer attestations are document artifacts (PDFs/scans) the principal uploads and the principal's signature commits to — modeled at the FW-0037 `capacity` layer or as response artifacts, not as additional parties.

**SNAP / Medicaid household-benefits disposition: FW-0037-shaped, not multi-party.** The lead respondent (head-of-household) authenticates once, holds one draft, signs the application once. Adult-attestants sign declarations **as exhibits attached to the principal's submission** — typically on paper, scanned, uploaded; or via a separate single-party Formspec flow whose signed Response is referenced as an exhibit artifact. The exhibit-signer's signature commits to the exhibit's bytes, not to the household application's `signedPayload.digest`; the head-of-household's signature commits to the assembled application including the exhibit-artifact hashes. No second authenticated respondent-side session against the household form; no per-party-scoped slice of the household draft; no per-party `IdentityProvider` claim coordinated by the formspec-web shell.

**Justification.** The load-bearing test is whether the substrate must orchestrate N concurrent or sequential respondent-side sessions over the **same Definition's draft**. SNAP / Medicaid head-of-household + adult-attestants does not — the adult-attestant artifact is sealed before the head-of-household session begins (paper/scan) or in a parallel single-party flow (the attestation form is its own Definition), and the head-of-household's signature commits to the artifact's hash. Forcing this case into multi-party would inflate every adopter's `multiParty` capability surface (per-party `DraftStore` scoping, per-party invitation channel, per-party deadline policy) for a flow whose actual orchestration is "principal uploads document; principal signs." That defeats the Q4 intake-only-vs-WOS-tier split (§2.4) — household benefits would be falsely tagged as needing the asymmetric tier (multiple roles) when client-side single-party orchestration handles it.

**Alternative rejected: model SNAP / Medicaid as multi-party with `asymmetricSecondary` attestants.** Considered because the upstream-extension-queue's earlier `parties` block sketch (now [EXT-28 at `2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:193`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md)) enumerated household-benefits as a four-scenario example. Rejected on three grounds: (1) the head-of-household + adult-attestants flow doesn't satisfy the session-continuity test above — adult attestants don't authenticate against the household form; (2) the existing FW-0037 capacity + `authorityArtifact` shape on `AuthoredSignature` (EXT-3) already models exhibit-attestation provenance without inflating the multi-party surface; (3) if a particular benefits jurisdiction does require each adult member to authenticate independently and sign their own scoped slice of the household form, that variant promotes to multi-party (`asymmetricPrimary` head + N `asymmetricSecondary` adults) at form-author discretion — the disposition is per-form, not per-scenario-class. The taxonomy supports the multi-party variant; the default disposition is FW-0037.

**Rationale (for the canonical-shape decision itself).** One port surface, one conformance suite, one resolved-runtime-profile shape under [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md). Three separate shapes would force three separate capability keys (`multiPartyCoEqual` / `multiPartyAsymmetric` / `multiPartyGuardian`), three policy resolutions, three sets of conformance fixtures, and three failure-semantic taxonomies — a 3× duplication of the same architectural shape. The taxonomy pattern is the one [web ADR-0011 Feature Ownership Table line 138](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) already uses for `allowed party roles` as an org-policy axis; this decision instantiates that slot rather than inventing a new axis.

**Alternative rejected: three shapes per scenario class (research brief Q1).** Cleaner per-case mental model; loses on conformance surface area and on the [web ADR-0004](../adr/0004-cross-repo-placement-consume-not-invent.md) discipline (one upstream primitive vs three). The research brief's `§3.1`–`§3.4` scenarios differ in role asymmetry and visibility scoping, not in shape; collapsing them into role-parameter values keeps the contract narrow.

**Counter-argument addressed (child-custody disagreement-as-state).** The brief flags that custody's "disagreement is a first-class state, not a silent override" ([JOURNEYS.md:708](../../JOURNEYS.md)) may not parameterize cleanly. It does, when the disagreement is modeled at the **field-level merge layer**, not at the party-role layer: roles declare who-can-edit-what; merge semantics declare what-happens-when-edits-conflict. Two `coEqual` parents editing the same field can both write; the merge result records both authored values with party attribution, not a winner. Disagreement-as-state is a merge-semantics property under §5, not a separate role.

### 2.2 Q2 — Async-first; sync as a later, separate design row

**PROPOSAL.** Multi-party submission is **async by default**. Party A fills, signs their slice, hands off. Party B authenticates separately, sees the post-handoff snapshot, fills their slice, signs theirs. No real-time co-presence required. Sync (real-time co-fill, two browsers updating the same draft live) is **explicitly deferred** to a separate design row.

**Rationale.** Async matches the existing solo-fill mental model: one respondent session, one draft, one signature, then handoff. Sync introduces a substantial substrate commitment (websocket transport, OT/CRDT convergence, presence indicators, concurrency-aware conflict resolution) that fan-outs across `DraftStore`, the engine reactive state, every adapter, and every conformance fixture. The research brief's J-041 evidence ([JOURNEYS.md:708](../../JOURNEYS.md)) names "per-party signature ceremonies that don't require synchronous co-presence" — async is the explicit user-value target. Sync is a nice-to-have, not on the J-041 critical path.

**Alternative rejected: sync-first or both.** Sync-first builds the harder thing first and discovers the async use cases anyway. Both-at-once doubles the port surface and the conformance burden for a capability where the async path covers every J-041 scenario.

**Consequence noted.** Async means the signature on Party A's slice may freeze before Party B has signed theirs. The byte protocol supports this — research brief `§1.3` cites that the Formspec Signed Response Payload digest is stable when co-signatures are appended ([`formspec/schemas/response.schema.json:54`](../../../formspec/schemas/response.schema.json)). Whether **edits** are frozen post-Party-A-signature is a merge-semantics decision (§5.3), not a sync/async decision.

### 2.3 Q3 — Definition-time party-role declaration; runtime party-binding

**PROPOSAL.** The form Definition pre-enumerates **party roles** (e.g., "petitioner", "beneficiary"); the runtime binds actual identities to those role slots. Dynamic per-form addition of new role types is out of scope; runtime-known parties bind to design-time-known roles only.

**Rationale.** Matches Formspec's spec-first discipline: the Definition is the authoritative declaration of what the form is, and "who-signs-what" is a property of the form, not of the runtime. Definition-time declaration is validatable (the engine can refuse to render a form with conflicting role/visibility declarations), discoverable (the resolved runtime profile per [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) can answer "does this form need multi-party?" before any party authenticates), and stable (a downstream verifier checking a multi-party receipt knows from the Definition version which roles were structurally legal).

**Alternative rejected: dynamic runtime party-addition.** The research brief Q3 flags this as the household-benefits case where the lead respondent invites N adult attestants whose count isn't known at design time. Two answers:

1. Variable **count** at runtime is supported: a role can be declared with cardinality (`{role: "adultAttestant", cardinality: "1..N"}`) and the runtime binds 1 to N identities to that role slot. The Definition still declares the role type.
2. Variable **role types** at runtime — the lead respondent inventing a new role on the fly — is forbidden. If the form's authoring side didn't anticipate a role, the form is not modeling it; ad hoc role invention defeats per-role visibility/signing declarations.

This split keeps the cardinality-variable case in scope without giving up Definition-time validation. **Note:** per the §2.1 disposition rule, SNAP / Medicaid head-of-household + adult-attestants is FW-0037-shaped by default; the variable-cardinality multi-party path described here applies to the jurisdiction-specific variant where each adult member authenticates independently against the household form (rare).

### 2.4 Q4 — Intake-only viable for `coEqual` only; WOS governance required for asymmetric roles

**PROPOSAL.** The **intake-only path** (formspec-web + formspec engine + intake-handoff, no `workspec-server` co-investment) is viable for the simplest case: two-or-more `coEqual` parties signing the same payload, no per-party state-machine differences, no governance branching. Joint tax filing fits.

The **WOS-orchestrated path** kicks in when **any of** the following is true:

1. Any party role is `asymmetricPrimary` or `asymmetricSecondary` (the roles trigger different downstream obligations).
2. Any party role is `guardianFor` (the legal-capacity check is a governance step, not a renderer step).
3. The form's runtime policy under [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) declares per-party deadlines, per-party reminders, or per-party invitation orchestration.
4. The form requires per-party post-submission case-state visibility (per-party `StatusReader` results — see §6.3).

**Trigger boundary, stated precisely.** Intake-only is viable when all parties play the **same role** with the **same downstream obligations** and the orchestration is entirely client-side (no server needs to track "Party B has not signed yet"). Anything else routes through WOS.

**Rationale.** Per [web ADR-0011 line 138](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md), `multiParty` is one instance capability with a single org-policy axis (`allowed party roles`). The runtime feature resolver can produce a resolved profile that says "this form needs `multiParty` at the `asymmetric` tier" — and the absence of a WOS-backed adapter fails closed per ADR-0011's `UnsupportedRequiredFeatureError`. This pattern lets the joint-tax case ship over a small intake-only adapter while the asymmetric cases wait for WOS co-investment.

**Alternative rejected: intake-only across the board.** Loses immigration-sponsorship and custody cases — exactly the J-041 markets where the architectural significance argument lives ([JOURNEYS.md:707](../../JOURNEYS.md)).

**Alternative rejected: WOS-always.** Forces every joint-tax adopter to deploy `workspec-server` for a case where client-side orchestration suffices. Defeats [web ADR-0009](../adr/0009-hexagonal-architecture-ports-and-adapters.md)'s adopter-diversity charter.

## 3. Capability key and port shape

### 3.1 Capability key under web ADR-0011

The `multiParty` instance-capability row from [web ADR-0011 Feature Ownership Table line 138](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) is the contract this design instantiates. The resolution layers per ADR-0011:

| Layer | What it carries for `multiParty` |
|---|---|
| Instance capability | Adapter-backed party/session orchestration; tier (`coEqual` / `asymmetric`) is part of the capability evidence — instance declares the highest tier it can serve |
| Org policy | `allowed party roles` (closed enum subset of the Q1 taxonomy) plus per-party assurance floors, deadline policy, invitation channel allow-list |
| Form policy | Form declares required `multiParty` tier (`coEqual` or `asymmetric`) **as a first-class authoring declaration** (not derived); plus the per-role assurance floor required for each declared role |
| Resolved runtime profile | Enabled features + per-role policy resolution; the form-load boundary throws `UnsupportedRequiredFeatureError` if the instance tier doesn't satisfy the form's required tier |

**Tier is a first-class form-policy declaration, not a runtime-derived value.** The form author declares `multiParty.tier` on the Definition; the resolver consumes it; the runtime does not compute it from `(roles, visibilityScope, disagreement-merge-presence)`. This is the load-bearing decision driving the rest of §3: without it, an instance with intake-only `coEqual`-capable orchestration looks like it can serve an immigration-sponsorship form (the resolver would let the form load and the failure would surface at signature time), and worse, the custody case (§4.3 — `coEqual` roles requiring `asymmetric` tier because of per-party visibility and disagreement-merge complexity) cannot be expressed at all by any deterministic derivation rule. Tiered capability fails closed at form-load per ADR-0011's failure-semantics discipline.

**Rejected alternative: derive tier from `(roles, visibilityScope, disagreement-as-state-present)`.** Considered because it removes one form-author burden. Rejected because custody (§4.3) is the counterexample: roles are `coEqual` and the form may opt into disagreement-merge or per-party visibility independently, so the derivation rule would need to bake in "if visibility is scoped OR disagreement-merge is declared, force tier to `asymmetric`" — at which point the form author is effectively still declaring tier, just through three correlated proxies instead of one explicit axis. Implicit derivation also makes tier silently drift when an author adds a private-to-party field to a form previously declared `coEqual`; explicit declaration surfaces the orchestration-tier change at the same edit where the privacy change happens.

### 3.2 Port shape — proposal: no new port, conditional

Per [web ADR-0009](../adr/0009-hexagonal-architecture-ports-and-adapters.md) the discipline is "don't speculate on port shapes before consumer code" and "port what's adopter-shaped; encapsulate the rest." Applying that discipline to multi-party:

**Proposal: extend three existing ports rather than add a new `MultiPartyOrchestrator` port.**

| Existing port | What multi-party adds |
|---|---|
| `DraftStore` | Per-party draft scope. The same draft id resolves to N party-scoped slices; reads/writes are scoped by `(draftId, partyId)`. Round-trip invariant per ADR-0009 still holds (a `Response` per party slice). |
| `IdentityProvider` | No shape change. Each party authenticates through its own session; the shell holds N `IdentityClaim` values rather than 1. Cross-port coordination (whose claim is "current") lives in the shell per ADR-0009. |
| `SubmitTransport` | The submit envelope carries the merged multi-party `Response` (with per-party `authoredSignatures[]` entries depending on EXT-3); idempotency-key convention unchanged. |

**Why not a new port.** A `MultiPartyOrchestrator` port would either (a) be a thin wrapper over `DraftStore` + `IdentityProvider` (in which case it's a leak), or (b) own party-invitation, deadline-tracking, and per-party state — which is exactly what WOS already owns under Q4's asymmetric tier. Adding a port whose production implementation is "call WOS" creates the kind of architectural seam web ADR-0009 §"Not in the constitutional inventory" warns against. The intake-only `coEqual` tier can be served by the three extended ports above; the WOS-orchestrated asymmetric tier consumes WOS through `SubmitTransport`'s intake-handoff path plus an extension of the WOS applicant API (§6.2) — not a new client-side port.

**Conditional clause.** If FW-0061's build surfaces a real per-party-invitation flow that doesn't fit `DraftStore` / `IdentityProvider` / `SubmitTransport`, the build row may ratify a new port at that point. The discipline is to defer the port shape decision until the consumer code forces it, per [web ADR-0006](../adr/0006-issuer-sidecar-spec-request.md)'s retroactive lesson.

### 3.3 Resolution contract addition

The `ResolvedRuntimeProfile` consumed by the React shell per [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) gains a `multiParty` block:

```text
multiParty?: {
  tier: "coEqual" | "asymmetric"        // mirrors Definition.parties.tier (form-authored, not derived — see §3.1)
  parties: Array<{
    roleId: string                      // matches Definition.parties[*].roleId
    role: "coEqual" | "asymmetricPrimary" | "asymmetricSecondary" | "guardianFor"
    cardinality: { min: number, max: number | "unbounded" }
    assuranceFloor: { ial?, aal? }      // per-role minimum, ADR-0011 + ADR-0140
    visibilityScope: "shared" | "scoped" // §5 governs scoping rules
  }>
  invitationChannel: "magic-link" | "wos-task" | "out-of-band"
  deadlinePolicy?: { perPartyDeadline?: Duration, expirationAction: "void-submission" | "convert-to-partial" }
}
```

The `tier` field is a **mirror of the Definition-level form-policy declaration**, not a value the resolver computes from the `parties[*].role` taxonomy or from `visibilityScope`. Per §3.1, tier and roles are orthogonal axes: roles encode signature semantics (who-signs-what), tier encodes orchestration complexity (what-orchestration-the-instance-must-provide). The custody case (§4.3) is the load-bearing example — `coEqual` roles with `asymmetric` tier — and is only expressible because tier is declared, not derived. EXT-28 (the `parties` block on `definition.schema.json`, [`2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:193`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md)) must carry the `tier` field at form-policy level alongside the role enumeration.

The block is the resolver's read-only output. Adapters do not consume it directly; the shell does, and orchestrates ports against it. This keeps the port-extension surface narrow per [web ADR-0009](../adr/0009-hexagonal-architecture-ports-and-adapters.md).

## 4. Three worked scenarios

Each scenario shows: party-role bindings, the resolved runtime profile, which ports get exercised, what ships in MVP-tier vs WOS-tier.

### 4.1 Joint US tax filing (research brief §3.1) — intake-only

- **Roles:** Two `coEqual` parties, no per-party scope split (entire return is jointly authored and jointly attested per IRS Form 1040).
- **Resolved profile:** `multiParty.tier = "coEqual"`, two `coEqual` party slots with cardinality `{min:2, max:2}`, `visibilityScope: "shared"`.
- **Ports exercised:** `DraftStore` (single shared draft, two `authoredSignatures[]` entries), `IdentityProvider` (two sessions over time), `SubmitTransport` (one merged Response). No WOS dependency required for the minimum path.
- **MVP-tier viable:** yes, for adopters whose `multiParty` instance capability is intake-only `coEqual`. The submit is one Response with two `AuthoredSignature` entries; EXT-3's `capacity = "self"` + new `partyRole = "coEqual"` field identify each signer's role.

### 4.2 Immigration sponsorship I-130 + I-485 (research brief §3.2) — WOS-tier

- **Roles:** One `asymmetricPrimary` (petitioner) + one `asymmetricSecondary` (beneficiary). Different signature blocks, different attestation obligations, asymmetric per-section visibility (petitioner does not see beneficiary's prior visa denials).
- **Resolved profile:** `multiParty.tier = "asymmetric"`, two distinct role slots, `visibilityScope: "scoped"` with per-section visibility per `definition.schema.json` `visibleTo[]` (XS-1 dependency).
- **Ports exercised:** `DraftStore` (per-party scoped slices keyed by `(draftId, partyId)`), `IdentityProvider` (separate sessions, separate assurance floors per role), `SubmitTransport` (intake-handoff to WOS with `subjects[]` carrying both parties, per XS-1 `parties` block + `partySignatures[]`).
- **MVP-tier blocked:** the asymmetric tier requires WOS co-investment for per-party task assignment, per-party deadlines, and per-party post-submission status. Form-load fails closed with `UnsupportedRequiredFeatureError` per [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) on instances that don't wire the WOS-tier adapter.

### 4.3 Child custody filing (research brief §3.3) — WOS-tier with merge-semantics requirements

- **Roles:** Two `coEqual` parents (the child is the **subject**, not a party — per research brief `§3.3`, the child neither fills nor signs; modeled as `intake-handoff.subjectRef` not as a party-role slot).
- **Resolved profile:** `multiParty.tier = "asymmetric"` — the form author declares the tier explicitly on the Definition (per §3.1 and §3.3 — tier is form-authored, not derived from `(roles, visibilityScope, disagreement-merge-presence)`). The custody form's author chooses `asymmetric` tier because the form requires per-party visibility scoping (FW-0049/FW-0060 dependency) and disagreement-merge semantics (§5.4) — both orchestration-complexity properties that exceed `coEqual`-tier intake-only capability. This is the canonical case where the **tier** axis tracks orchestration complexity and the **role** axis tracks signature semantics, and the two diverge: `coEqual` roles + `asymmetric` tier.
- **Ports exercised:** `DraftStore` (per-party scoped slices with overlap), `IdentityProvider` (two sessions), `SubmitTransport` (merged Response carrying disagreement-as-state per §5).
- **MVP-tier blocked.** Safe-address per-party visibility (§6.1 dependency on FW-0049/FW-0060) is the hard prerequisite; without it, a survivor's address could leak to the co-parent through the joint receipt.

## 5. Failure semantics and merge

### 5.1 Party 2 never returns (timeout / abandonment)

Two sub-cases driven by the resolved-profile `deadlinePolicy.expirationAction`:

- **`void-submission`** (default for asymmetric tier and for any safe-address-affected form): the submission is voided; Party A's signature is recorded as `partySignature.status = "revoked-on-expiration"` via an EXT-5-extended ledger event; no intake-handoff lands. Party A is notified that their signature did not result in a submission.
- **`convert-to-partial`** (legal for `coEqual` tier where the form explicitly declares partial submissions as valid — rare; e.g. the jurisdiction-specific multi-party variant of SNAP-style household applications where each adult authenticates against the household form, with a "if cohabitant declines, mark as single-applicant variant" rule — per §2.1 disposition this is the non-default household-benefits shape): the intake-handoff lands with `partySignatures[]` carrying only Party A's entry and an `EXT-5 partyMissing` ledger event annotating the missing role slot.

**Default is `void-submission`.** Adopters opt into `convert-to-partial` per form-policy and only if the form's authoring side declares the partial-submission shape — silent downgrade is forbidden per [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md)'s failure-semantics rule.

### 5.2 Party 1 withdraws after Party 2 signed

Three lifecycle ledger events covered by EXT-5 are required (research brief `§1.1` `respondent-ledger-spec.md:322` already has the `delegate` actor type to extend):

- `partySignature.requested` — when Party A invites Party B
- `partySignature.received` — when Party B signs their slice
- `partySignature.revoked` — when any party withdraws their signature post-receipt-of-another-party's-signature

The merged Response carries the surviving signatures plus the revocation event in the ledger sidecar. The receipt rendering surface (FW-0009, post-MVP) shows the chain: "Party B signed at T1; Party A revoked at T2; submission state = `multi-party-revoked`." No silent overwrite of Party B's signature.

**Constraint:** a party can withdraw only their **own** signature. No party can revoke another party's signature. The party-role contract is asymmetric in this direction even for `coEqual` roles.

### 5.3 Signature replay across parties

Each party signs over a `signedPayload.digest` per `formspec/schemas/response.schema.json:54`. Per the research brief `§1.1`, "the digest remains stable when later co-signatures are appended" — but only when the **content** doesn't change. Two protections:

1. **Per-party digest binding.** Each `AuthoredSignature` in the merged Response binds a specific `signedPayload.digest` value at the moment that party signed. If Party A's edit changes the digest after Party B signed, Party B's signature's `signedPayload.digest` no longer matches the current merged Response — verifier surfaces "Party B's signature is over a prior version of this submission." This is a verifier requirement, not a renderer one, and lives downstream of MVP per [web ADR-0005](../adr/0005-mvp-scope-defer-cryptographic-substrate.md).
2. **Edit-freeze after second-party signature.** Once any party other than Party A has signed, Party A's slice is **read-only** until either (a) Party A revokes their signature (§5.2) and all post-Party-A signatures revoke with it (cascade), or (b) all parties re-sign. This is a UI affordance the React shell enforces over the `DraftStore` extension; the substrate enforcement is the digest-binding above.

Cascade revocation policy: when a party revokes, every downstream party signature that depended on the revoked content (every signature in the merged Response with `signedPayload.digest` referencing pre-revocation state) is marked `dependent-revocation` in the ledger. The intake-handoff either re-opens for re-signature or transitions to voided per the form's `deadlinePolicy`.

### 5.4 Disagreement as first-class state (Q1 follow-through)

For `coEqual` roles editing a shared field (child custody §4.3), if both parties write different values, the field carries both values with party attribution in the merged Response. Per [web ADR-0004](../adr/0004-cross-repo-placement-consume-not-invent.md) the schema shape is **upstream-owned**; this design proposes the shape for XS-1 (§6.2 (5) below) and notes it as a hard dependency. The illustrative shape (subject to upstream ratification):

```text
"answers": {
  "primaryCaregiver": {
    "_multiPartyDisagreement": true,
    "values": [
      { "value": "Party A", "byParty": "parent-1", "attestedAt": "T1" },
      { "value": "Party B", "byParty": "parent-2", "attestedAt": "T2" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The renderer surfaces the disagreement to both parties before signature ceremony. The submitted Response carries the disagreement; the downstream consumer (court, in the custody case) sees both attested values. **No silent merge winner.** Without a Response-schema mechanism carrying both attested values, J-041's "disagreement is a first-class state, not a silent override" ([JOURNEYS.md:708](../../JOURNEYS.md)) is not modeled. The actual field name and structure are XS-1's call (§6.2 (5)); the load-bearing requirement is that the mechanism exist.

## 6. Cross-stack dependency chain

Honest about which parts of this design FW-0050 can ratify standalone vs which parts wait on upstream ratification.

### 6.1 The chain

```
FW-0050 design (this doc)
    ↓
XS-1 ratification (stack-root ADR — not yet authored)
    ↓
EXT-3 spec change (formspec — capacity + party-role on AuthoredSignature)
+ EXT-28 (definition.schema.json `parties` block + tier + per-item `visibleTo[]`)
    ↓
FW-0061 build (formspec-web)
```

### 6.2 XS-1 — multi-party intake cross-stack ADR (not yet authored)

The research brief flagged XS-1 as queued; this design verifies it is **not yet authored** at stack-root (checked `formspec-stack/thoughts/adr/` 2026-05-23 — no multi-party intake ADR present; ADR-0151 and ADR-0152 are the closest, but they cover Studio authoring-time multi-actor, not respondent-time multi-party — see §1.2). FW-0050's design proposes XS-1 content from the formspec-web perspective:

**XS-1 proposed content (consumer perspective):**

1. **Boundary:** at `intake-handoff`. Formspec owns the per-party artifact contract (Definition `parties` block, Response `partySignatures[]`); WOS owns per-party session orchestration above the asymmetric-tier threshold (Q4); Trellis substrate is unchanged (multi-signer composition already supported per research brief `§1.3` `trellis-operational-companion.md:1340` `append/029` fixture).
2. **Tier axis:** XS-1 ratifies the `coEqual` vs `asymmetric` tier split (Q1 + Q4) as the spec-level distinction that drives both the schema and the orchestration boundary.
3. **WOS extension:** the applicant API ([`work-spec/specs/api/applicant.md:27`](../../../work-spec/specs/api/applicant.md)) gains a multi-applicant projection. The cleanest shape is an `actorExtension` for `co-applicant` per kernel S10.1 (research brief `§1.2`), with per-party `ApplicantTaskSummary` slots and per-party status reads.
4. **Per-party visibility model:** per-item `visibleTo[]` on the Definition (research brief Q5 prefers per-section over per-item; this design defers the per-item vs per-section decision to XS-1 ratification — both are spec-author calls, not formspec-web's). Whichever shape ratifies, the resolver pattern from §3.1 carries it through.
5. **Disagreement-as-state mechanism on Response:** a Response-schema extension that lets a field carry multiple attested values with per-party attribution and per-party timestamps (illustrative shape in §5.4). Required so J-041's "disagreement is a first-class state, not a silent override" ([JOURNEYS.md:708](../../JOURNEYS.md)) is structurally modeled rather than authored ad-hoc per consumer. The exact field name and shape are XS-1 / formspec spec-author calls; the load-bearing requirement is the mechanism's existence.
6. **Trellis no-op:** XS-1 does not introduce new envelope formats; per the research brief `§1.3`, sequential per-party signing over a digest-stable Formspec Signed Response Payload already works at the byte level.

**Without XS-1 ratification, FW-0050 design cannot be acted on by FW-0061.** The dependency is hard.

### 6.3 EXT-3 — capacity + party-role on AuthoredSignature (queued)

Per [`thoughts/specs/2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:47`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md). EXT-3 currently proposes adding `capacity` + `principalRef` + `authorityArtifact` to support FW-0037 (filer-not-signer). FW-0050 requires EXT-3 plus a strict superset: a `partyRole` field bound to `definition.schema.json.parties[*].roleId` so the receipt can render "Party A signed in role `petitioner` with capacity `self`."

**This is one EXT-3 extension, not two.** The capacity primitive (FW-0037) and the party-role primitive (FW-0050) share the `AuthoredSignature` extension surface; landing them together avoids two passes over the same schema.

### 6.4 EXT-28 — Definition `parties` block

Landed in the upstream extension queue at [`2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:193`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md) as part of FW-0050's design landing. This design proposes:

- **EXT-28 (`parties` block on `definition.schema.json`)** — form-level `parties: PartyRole[]` declaring role slots with cardinality, plus a form-policy `tier: "coEqual" | "asymmetric"` declaration (form-authored, not derived — per §3.1), plus per-item `visibleTo[]` / `editableBy[]` / `signedBy[]` (or per-section equivalent — XS-1 decides). Closes the per-party visibility model the FW-0050 design depends on. The queue entry at [`2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:193`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md) currently enumerates the role/visibility shape; the `tier` form-policy field is added by this design's MED-2 remediation and should land in EXT-28 alongside the role enumeration.

### 6.5 What FW-0050 ratifies standalone

**Standalone ratifiable today (no upstream dependency):**

- The Q1–Q4 framing decisions, scoped to formspec-web's consumer perspective.
- The `multiParty` capability shape under [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) — the resolver block in §3.3, the tier axis, the failure-semantics binding.
- The decision **not** to add a `MultiPartyOrchestrator` port (§3.2).
- The per-party draft-scope extension to `DraftStore` (§3.2) — the conformance fixture pattern can be authored now even if the build waits.
- The merge-semantics shape (§5) — proposed for inclusion in XS-1.

**Waits on upstream:**

- The Definition `parties` block + form-policy `tier` declaration + per-item visibility (EXT-28).
- The `partyRole` field on `AuthoredSignature` (EXT-3 extension).
- The `subjects[]` and `partySignatures[]` shapes on `intake-handoff` (XS-1).
- The WOS applicant API extension for multi-applicant projection (XS-1 + WOS ADR).
- The receipt rendering surface for multi-party (post-MVP per [web ADR-0005](../adr/0005-mvp-scope-defer-cryptographic-substrate.md)).

## 7. Hard binding to other FW rows

### 7.1 FW-0049 / FW-0060 — safe-address (load-bearing)

FW-0060 explicitly cites: "per-party visibility (per FW-0050) land across the form, the receipt, and the verifier" ([`PLANNING.md:682`](../../PLANNING.md)). The dependency is bidirectional:

- FW-0050 depends on FW-0049's privacy-class taxonomy for marking which fields are protectable.
- FW-0060 depends on FW-0050's per-party visibility model for determining which co-party should not see the protected field.

**Composition rule:** when a form declares both `multiParty` and `safeAddress` features, the resolved runtime profile composes them: a protectable field's `visibleTo[]` is intersected with the safe-address jurisdictional rule. If the intersection is empty (no party can legally see the protected value), the form-load surfaces an `InvalidRuntimePolicyError` per [web ADR-0011](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md). Silent leak forbidden.

The child-custody scenario (§4.3) is the canonical instance: survivor parent's safe-address-protected home address must not be visible to the co-parent. This composition is the architectural requirement; the design does not ship FW-0060 (that's FW-0049's design row) but does declare the seam.

**FW-0049 design — RESOLVED 2026-05-23.** [FW-0049 design `thoughts/specs/2026-05-23-fw-0049-safe-address-handling-design.md`](2026-05-23-fw-0049-safe-address-handling-design.md) is the canonical safe-address-class-taxonomy + audience-policy source. §3.1 specifies the `safe-*` class set (`safe-address`, `safe-contact`, `safe-employer`); §3.2 collapses the schema onto `accessControl.class` per stack-root ADR-0074 (retiring the proposed EXT-1 `privacy` block); §3.5 specifies the receipt-side audience contract; §7 explicitly satisfies the right half of the FW-0050 §7.1 composition rule with the worked child-custody example at §7.2. **FW-0061 build consumes the FW-0049 §7 shape directly** — the resolver intersects the safe-* audience policy (excludes-public-receipt) with the multi-party `visibleTo[]` per-party scoping; canonical case yields `visibleTo = parentA + issuer-verification`, empty-intersection cases surface `InvalidRuntimePolicyError` at form-load. **The design dependency closes here.** Build-time dependency on FW-0049's build row (FW-0060 in `PLANNING.md`) remains: FW-0060's `SafeAddressDirectory` adapter + Phase 2+ commitment-slot writer + Disclosure Manifest emitter must exist before FW-0061 can ship the per-party safe-address visibility scoping, OR FW-0061 must descope safe-address from its initial slice.

### 7.2 AP-014 — coercion (J-041 explicit binding)

J-041 names AP-014 ([`JOURNEYS.md:710`](../../JOURNEYS.md)) and explicitly: "joint flows controlled by one party are the worst kind of coercion vector." The design implications:

1. **No party can submit on Party B's behalf.** Each party's signature is authenticated by their own `IdentityProvider` session; the shell rejects any path where one party's session signs another party's slice. Enforced by per-party draft-scope under §3.2.
2. **Per-party duress channel** (FW-0048 design landed 2026-05-23; FW-0059 build dependency). Party B's duress signal must not be observable to Party A. The `submission.duress-signaled` event from [EXT-5 in `2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md:73`](2026-05-22-upstream-extension-queue.md) lands in a private-sidecar per `trellis-operational-companion.md` §13 — for multi-party, the per-party-private sidecar discipline must be **per-party**, not per-form. **[FW-0048 design `thoughts/specs/2026-05-23-fw-0048-coercion-aware-signing-design.md`](2026-05-23-fw-0048-coercion-aware-signing-design.md) is the canonical sidecar shape; §7 of that design satisfies this delegation explicitly** — `partyRef?` field on the EXT-5 payload, per-party invisibility guarantees at receipt / status / ceremony surfaces, and FW-0061 build constraints (per-party safety-routing dispatch via the deferred adapter shape per FW-0048 §4.2, per-party HPKE-wrap via Trellis Core §6.4 `payload_ref` + §9.4 `key_bag`, multi-party fixture coverage matrix). FW-0061 reads FW-0048 §7 directly and wires the per-party composition; no shape-invention here.
3. **No party-visible "Party B has not signed yet" surface that Party A can poll.** The post-submit status surface (FW-0039) becomes party-scoped: `readStatus(caseId, partyId)` returns the requesting party's own status, not the other party's progress. This prevents Party A from using the status surface to coerce Party B.

The design surface that addresses AP-014 is **per-party invisibility of the duress channel**, **per-party-scope on status reads**, and **no party-to-party signature-on-behalf-of**.

### 7.3 Other FW interactions (deferred to follow-on rows)

Per the research brief `§2`:

- **FW-0008 (signer ceremony):** per-party scroll-to-end gate, per-party WYSIWYS preimage. The current FW-0008 design assumes single-party; the multi-party extension is a FW-0008 follow-on, not in FW-0050's scope.
- **FW-0030 (federated identity):** per-party identity proofing across IdPs is an N=N extension of the single-party identity contract. Defer to FW-0030.
- **FW-0042 (share-draft-with-trusted-reviewer):** reviewer ≠ co-party. The reviewer is read+comment, the co-party is read+edit-own-scope+sign-own-scope. Per the research brief, whether one sharing-sidecar covers both or they are separate is a follow-on design question; this design treats them as separate.
- **FW-0039 (post-submit status):** the party-scoped `StatusReader` extension above. Owned by FW-0039's evolution, not by FW-0050.
- **FW-0058 (AI-agent filer chain):** a party in a multi-party flow may be an AI-agent; the role taxonomy in Q1 does not preclude `agentChain` on a party's `AuthoredSignature`. FW-0058 owns the AI-agent shape; FW-0050 ensures the multi-party design does not foreclose it.

## 8. Open questions deferred to follow-on rows

These are real, called out so FW-0061 has a known surface to address (or so a follow-on design row absorbs them):

1. **Per-item vs per-section visibility (research brief Q5).** XS-1 ratifies the schema shape. This design accepts either; the resolved-profile pattern in §3.1 carries through.
2. **Per-party identity assurance composition (research brief Q6, FW-0030 binding).** When parties authenticate via different IdPs with different assurance levels, what's the form's effective assurance? Minimum-across-parties is the safe default; FW-0030 owns the actual rule.
3. **Withdrawal cascade semantics (§5.2 extension).** The dependent-revocation cascade is proposed; XS-1 must ratify the ledger event taxonomy that supports it (extension of EXT-5).
3a. **FW-0048 per-party duress sidecar — RESOLVED 2026-05-23.** FW-0048 design landed at [`thoughts/specs/2026-05-23-fw-0048-coercion-aware-signing-design.md`](2026-05-23-fw-0048-coercion-aware-signing-design.md) with §7 explicitly satisfying this row's §7.2 delegation: `partyRef?` field on the EXT-5 payload, per-party HPKE wrap per Trellis Core §9.4 suite 1, per-party invisibility across receipts / status reads / ceremony state, and the FW-0061 build-constraint matrix (per-party `SafetyRouting.dispatch()` retry semantics, per-party commitment-slot population per OC-26, multi-party fixture coverage). FW-0061 consumes the FW-0048 shape directly; **the design dependency closes here**. Build-time dependency on FW-0048's build row (FW-0059 in `PLANNING.md`) remains: FW-0059's `SafetyRouting` adapter must exist before FW-0061 can ship the per-party duress flow, OR FW-0061 must descope the duress affordance from its initial slice.
4. **Sync co-fill** (Q2 deferral). Separate design row when pulled forward.
5. **AI-agent co-party** (FW-0058 deferral). The taxonomy extension is straightforward; the ceremony semantics are not. FW-0058 owns.
6. **Per-party post-submission lifecycle actions** (amend / withdraw / dispute scoped per-party). [Web ADR-0011's `recordLifecycle`](../adr/0011-runtime-feature-resolution-and-policy-gates.md) capability composes with `multiParty`; the composition rules are a FW-0061 build concern.
7. **Definition-time validation of role configuration.** Whether the formspec engine refuses to render a form whose `parties` block has conflicting role/visibility declarations. Engine-side concern, follow-on to EXT-28.
8. **Reviewer-vs-party single-sidecar question (FW-0042 interaction).** Two separate sharing primitives, or one? Owner of the decision is unclear; flag for FW-0042's design row.

## 9. Decision summary

| Decision | Status | Owner of any pushback |
|---|---|---|
| Q1: one parameterized shape with closed role taxonomy | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| Q2: async-first; sync deferred | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| Q3: Definition-time role declaration + runtime party binding | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| Q4: intake-only for `coEqual`; WOS-required for asymmetric | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| `multiParty` capability tier axis (§3.1) | PROPOSAL | owner review + ADR-0011 evolution |
| No new `MultiPartyOrchestrator` port (§3.2) | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| Extend `DraftStore` + `IdentityProvider` + `SubmitTransport` (§3.2) | PROPOSAL | owner review |
| XS-1 boundary at `intake-handoff` (§6.2) | PROPOSAL to stack-root | stack-root architecture review |
| EXT-3 extends to carry `partyRole` (§6.3) | PROPOSAL to formspec | formspec spec-expert review |
| EXT-28 for Definition `parties` block (§6.4) | PROPOSAL to formspec | formspec spec-expert review |
| Disagreement-as-state at field-merge layer (§5.4) | PROPOSAL | owner review + XS-1 ratification |

**Row status change:** FW-0050 moves from `open` to `in design`. FW-0050 stays open until this design is owner-ratified and the upstream chain (XS-1 → EXT-3 → EXT-28) has at least proposed shapes.
