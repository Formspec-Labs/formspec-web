 * The heading depth a titled group renders at. Groups start at the root depth — `3` unless the form is
 * given another, one below the heading the page places above it — and each titled group puts its children
 * one level deeper, as `<formspec-render>` does while it walks (`rendering/emit-node.ts`). A titled group at
 * the root depth is a section (`formspec-group--section`), which the skins space apart from the groups
 * inside it; that is structural, so the same group is a section whatever depth the form started at.
