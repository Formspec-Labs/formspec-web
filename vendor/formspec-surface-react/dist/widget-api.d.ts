/**
 * @filedesc The module-widget delivery contract, in React terms.
 *
 * The Registry has always been able to *declare* a widget — name, version,
 * status, `childrenPolicy`, `tokenSlots`, a `widgetShape.props` JSON Schema.
 * Nothing could *deliver* one. This is the delivery side: the props a widget
 * receives and the shape a module publishes.
 *
 * ## What a widget is given, and what it is deliberately not
 *
 * - `config` — the authored `binding.config`, kept strictly as static
 *   configuration. Lint E604 validates it against the Registry entry's
 *   `widgetShape.props`; nothing validates it at runtime, so a widget reads it
 *   defensively.
 * - `data` — a frozen object keyed only by Registry-declared input names. Each
 *   value came through the Surface binding's exact Data Sources catalog/source
 *   pair and the canonical loader's availability, authorization and validation
 *   checks. Configuration never enters this object.
 * - `headingLevel` — where this widget's own headings sit in the page outline.
 *   A widget that hardcodes `<h2>` breaks the outline the moment it is embedded.
 * - `admitsTenantTheme` — whether the route it landed on admits tenant chrome.
 *   A widget does not decide this and cannot change it; it is told, so a widget
 *   that would otherwise paint a tenant accent can render its unbranded form.
 *
 * - `emitAction` — the only action capability. The widget names a declared
 *   output. It never sees the mapped Response Actions id or a route.
 *
 * A widget is NOT given navigation, an executor, or the route table. A
 * module-supplied widget navigating the app is a module deciding the app's
 * route graph, and transitions are the shell's (`transitions.ts`).
