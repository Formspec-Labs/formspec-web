/**
 * @filedesc The starter widget set, and the module that publishes it.
 *
 * Four widgets: a lead-in banner for an intake route, a frame for a signing act,
 * a receipt panel, and an operator queue. They are the four the
 * surface-render-v10 bundle binds, and they are also the four shapes that recur
 * across every app of this kind — which is why they ship rather than being left
 * for each tenant to rebuild.
 *
 * ## The names, and which vocabulary they are in
 *
 * The keys of {@link STARTER_WIDGETS} are `widgetShape.widgetName` values — the
 * name a Surface `module-widget` binding writes, which the schema leaves
 * unpatterned (ADR 0160 §2.4). They are NOT `RegistryEntry.name` contribution
 * ids and NOT Theme's `CustomWidgetName`. `@formspec-org/surface`'s
 * `widgetContributionFor` maps between the first two; nothing here should.
 *
 * ## Rebinding
 *
 * {@link starterWidgetModule} takes the module id, so the same components can be
 * published under whichever module a bundle declares. A tenant that wants its
 * own banner ships its own module and its own component; a tenant that wants the
 * platform's binds this one. Both go through the same seam.
