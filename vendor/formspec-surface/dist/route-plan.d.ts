/**
 * @filedesc The route plan — one matched route, fully decided, with every
 * diagnostic the deciding produced.
 *
 * `surface-shell-spec.md` defines *route plan* as "the shell core's output for
 * one matched route: the resolved slots in order, the theme grant, the
 * transition plan, and the diagnostics." Those four were produced by three
 * separate calls a binding had to make in the right order and union itself, and
 * the shipped React binding unioned three of the four: `planRoute` and
 * `planTransitions` diagnostics were computed per route and **discarded**, so
 * `SLOT-BINDING-INCOMPLETE`, `STATIC-IMAGE-NO-ALT`, `EMBED-ROUTE-*`,
 * `WIDGET-*`, per-slot `BUNDLE-DOCUMENT-MISSING` and every
 * `TRANSITION-UNFIREABLE` reached the screen and never the host. Per-route
 * stages produce most of the code set, so that delivered the minority of it.
 *
 * This module is why that cannot happen again: the union is here, once, in the
 * core, and a binding that renders a {@link SurfaceRoutePlan} has the whole
 * diagnostic list in its hand by construction. §7.1: "Every diagnostic the
 * shell produces MUST reach the host's diagnostic channel, whatever stage
 * produced it."
 *
 * It also puts the `supplied-by-slot` walk (§5.3) on the same side of the seam
 * as the slot plan it walks, which is the only place it can be got right once.
