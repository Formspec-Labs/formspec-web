/**
 * @filedesc Bundle export → typed artifacts a renderer can hold.
 *
 * A bundle export is `{manifest, documents}`: the manifest indirects every
 * artifact through a URL, and `documents` holds each one keyed by that URL. A
 * shell cannot match its first route until something resolves those URLs into a
 * `SurfaceDocument`, a `ThemeDocument`, a `FormDefinition` (gap ledger
 * `bundle-manifest-dereference`).
 *
 * ## Why not `resolveArtifacts`
 *
 * `resolveArtifacts` (`@formspec-org/app-graph`) is genuinely on the public
 * export surface, knows every manifest slot and its `$formspec*` discriminator,
 * version-gates by `$formspecBundle`, and reports diagnostics instead of
 * throwing. It models a **different shape**, twice over:
 *
 * - it resolves sibling refs through a caller-supplied `ArtifactLoader`, i.e. a
 *   manifest whose artifacts live somewhere else — but a bundle export has
 *   already inlined them, so the loader a caller would pass is
 *   `({ref}) => export.documents[ref.url]`: the lookup itself, wrapped; and
 * - `ArtifactResolutionHandle.document` is `unknown` by design ("preserved only
 *   as data evidence"), so a renderer must narrow every artifact by hand.
 *
 * It is built to produce a validation report, not to hand a renderer typed
 * artifacts. This hands the renderer typed artifacts and resolves the App
 * Manifest entry Surface that runtime composition needs. It does not validate
 * discriminators, schemas, sibling versions, or unsupported manifest versions.
 * A host that wants that report runs `resolveArtifacts` alongside. The
 * validating bundle-export arm still belongs beside `resolveArtifacts`, and the
 * ledger entry stays open for it.
 *
 * ## Missing documents are diagnostics, not exceptions
 *
 * The spike threw on a missing document, reasoning that a shell rendering half a
 * bundle is worse than one that refuses. That is right about the *outcome* and
 * wrong about the *mechanism*: throwing means the host learns about one missing
 * artifact at a time and cannot show a person what is wrong. This collects every
 * absence and lets the host decide — refuse, or render what resolved with the
 * gaps named. {@link bundleIsRenderable} reports structural readiness only;
 * authenticity and deployment admission remain separate host decisions.
