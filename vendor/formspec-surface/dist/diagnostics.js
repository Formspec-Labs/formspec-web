/**
 * @filedesc Diagnostics a Surface shell reports instead of failing quietly.
 *
 * The surface-render-v10 spike's sharpest finding was not a missing feature —
 * it was silence. A tenant's brand colour was accepted by authoring, passed
 * validation, was signed into the release, emitted by the renderer, resolved in
 * the cascade, and painted nothing, **with no diagnostic anywhere in that
 * chain**. This module exists so a shell never repeats that shape: every place
 * the shell has to make a call the platform does not state, it renders what it
 * can AND says what it did.
 *
 * These are runtime-composition diagnostics, distinct from
 * `AppGraphDiagnostic` (authoring-time, `@formspec-org/app-graph`) and from
 * lint codes (`crates/formspec-lint`). A shell sees things neither can: which
 * route the browser is actually on, whether a host supplied a transition
 * executor, whether two Surfaces collided in one URL space.
 *
 * ## Severity is a property of the code, not of the call site
 *
 * `specs/surface/surface-shell-spec.md` §7.1 requires every
 * diagnostic to carry a severity "fixed per code", which hosts "MAY elevate,
 * MUST NOT demote". Fixed per code means the caller does not get to pick:
 * {@link surfaceDiagnostic} reads {@link SURFACE_DIAGNOSTIC_SEVERITY}, a total
 * map over the closed code set, so two sites reporting the same code cannot
 * disagree about how loud it is. A closed list a host can enumerate but not
 * rank is knowable and not actionable.
 */
/**
 * Closed set of runtime-composition diagnostic codes. Closed because an open
 * set is a set nothing can exhaustively handle — a host that wants to escalate
 * some codes and ignore others needs to know the whole list.
 *
 * The set is the shell spec's §7.2 table and nothing else. A code that is not
 * in that table is not in this array.
