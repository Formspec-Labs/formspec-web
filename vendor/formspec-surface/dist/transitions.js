/**
 * @filedesc Transitions — and the decision the surface-render-v10 spike forced.
 *
 * ## The question
 *
 * The spike's `/certify` route declares
 * `transitions: [{trigger: "submit", to: "receipt"}]`. The bundle does carry a
 * Response Actions document, but this route renders only static content and a
 * module widget. Neither loaded artifact declares a control that can invoke the
 * submit action. The transition is authored, schema-valid and signed, yet the
 * route cannot traverse it. The spike hand-built a "Continue" button and
 * recorded it as gap ledger `transition-has-no-trigger-source`, with the
 * question:
 * **does the shell own a default trigger affordance, or must the bundle declare
 * one?**
 *
 * ## The answer: the bundle declares it. The shell does not.
 *
 * This is not a taste call — `surface-spec.md` §4 "Transition trigger semantics"
 * and §5.1 "Runtime Route State Ownership" already answer it, twice:
 *
 * > A router MAY advance a Surface transition **only after** the referenced
 * > action or closed-core intent has completed successfully under Response
 * > Actions authority.
 *
 * > it **MUST NOT infer success from a click**, a rendered button, or a
 * > validation summary.
 *
 * A shell-owned "Continue" button is precisely the prohibited inference: a click
 * standing in for an action that never ran. Shipping one as a default would put
 * a spec violation in every host by construction, and would do it on exactly the
 * routes where it matters — a `submit` transition off an intake route means a
 * submission happened.
 *
 * So this module **plans** transitions and refuses to fire them. Each authored
 * transition resolves to one of {@link TransitionStatus}, and only `fireable`
 * gets an affordance:
 *
 * - the trigger resolves against a loaded Response Actions document (an
 *   `actions[*].id`, or a closed-core intent published by exactly one action —
 *   the same rule `validateSurfaceResponseActionTriggers` enforces at authoring
 *   time, using the same imported intent set), **and**
 * - the host supplied a {@link TransitionExecutor} that can run it under
 *   Response Actions authority.
 *
 * Everything else renders as a stated refusal naming which half is missing. The
 * refusal is the product: a signed bundle describing an app that cannot run is a
 * fact the person on the page, and the author who signed it, should both be able
 * to see.
 *
 * ## What validation catches before runtime
 *
 * Surface lint walks the route graph for reachability (E606). App-graph
 * validation separately emits E611 when a resolved trigger has no
 * validator-readable control source on the route, including one reached through
 * an embed. E611 is a warning because validation cannot see a host executor or
 * private widget behaviour. Runtime planning still fails closed and reports the
 * actual posture.

/**
 * Every trigger a control **already on this route** can raise.
 *
 * `surface-shell-spec.md` §5.3: "Resolving `supplied-by-slot` is a walk, not a
 * lookup." Two halves, and getting either wrong is the same defect —
 * substituting a shortcut for the resolution rule surface-spec §4 already
 * states:
 *
 * 1. **The scan descends `embed-route` transitively.** An embedded route's
 *    slots render on the host route's surface, so a control it renders is a
 *    control the host route renders — the same transitivity §4.4 applies to the
 *    theme grant. A shell that scans only a route's own `slots[]` reports a
 *    working page as dead.
 * 2. **The check follows the control this binding actually places.**
 *    `FormspecForm` auto-places one submit-intent Action and no other action.
 *    A plan that credited every published action would report a control that
 *    does not exist. The selected document and submit Action must each be
 *    unique, and the document must target the rendered Definition.
 *
 * A module widget contributes only through the complete declared chain:
 * Registry action output -> Surface action binding -> exact loaded action.
 * Private widget behaviour and coincident names contribute nothing.
 * `experience-unit` cannot contribute: a Unit's `actionRefs` name actions and
 * do not place controls, and drawing a button from one would derive layout from
 * Experience (experience-spec §1.4.1 prohibition 2).
