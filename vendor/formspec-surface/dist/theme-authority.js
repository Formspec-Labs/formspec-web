/**
 * @filedesc The runtime half of THEME-ROUTE-CLASS: the only place a shell is
 * allowed to read a tenant Theme.
 *
 * ## The shape, and why it is a factory rather than a function
 *
 * `THEME-ROUTE-CLASS` shipped as an authoring-time validator rule with no
 * runtime owner. A renderer that honours it "carefully" honours it until
 * someone adds a prop. What makes the boundary hold is structure, not care:
 *
 * - {@link createThemeAuthority} takes the tenant Theme **once**, closes over
 *   it, and returns an object whose only output is a {@link ThemeGrant}.
 * - On a refusing route class, the grant's `themeDocument` is built from the
 *   platform theme alone. The tenant's tokens are not merged, not overridden,
 *   not defaulted — the closure's tenant branch never runs. There is nothing
 *   for a careless prop downstream to leak, because nothing tenant-shaped was
 *   ever constructed on that path.
 * - Every route yields the same grant *type*, so there is no `null` arm inviting
 *   a later "just pass the theme when it's missing" fix.
 *
 * A host holding a `ThemeGrant` cannot get back to the tenant Theme through it.
 * That is the whole design.
 *
 * ## The rule is imported, never restated
 *
 * `ROUTE_CLASS_THEME_AUTHORITY` (`@formspec-org/app-graph`) decides. This module
 * reads it and supplies the words a person sees; it does not carry a second copy
 * of which classes admit. A shell that restated the map would be a shell that
 * could disagree with the validator that signed the bundle off.

/**
 * One sentence per class, in the language of the person reading the page rather
 * than of the spec. Keyed exhaustively over `RouteClass` by construction — a new
 * or renamed class fails to compile HERE, the same discipline
 * `ROUTE_CLASS_THEME_AUTHORITY` uses at its own decision site.
 *
 * The reasons are shipped rather than left to hosts because a refusal is a trust
 * claim: *"this signing page is not branded, so what you are agreeing to cannot
 * be dressed up."* Every host writing its own wording means one normative rule
 * reaches people as several different promises. Which class admits is still the
 * imported map's call; this only supplies the words.
