/**
 * @filedesc The shell's own person-facing vocabulary — enumerable, in one
 * place, and host-overridable.
 *
 * ## Why a shell authors any copy at all
 *
 * A shell renders what the bundle carries and invents nothing. But four states
 * exist that no artifact describes, because they are facts about the *render*
 * rather than about the app: a slot whose target is absent, a widget handed
 * nothing to show, a transition nothing can fire, an address the app does not
 * carry. Those need words, and the words are the shell's.
 *
 * ## Why they live here rather than beside the elements that render them
 *
 * `surface-shell-spec.md` §3.0: the set "MUST be small, MUST be enumerable, and
 * MUST be overridable by the host, because a shell that hard-codes them in one
 * language makes every deployment monolingual regardless of what the bundle's
 * Locale document says. The strings are the shell's; the language is not the
 * shell's to fix."
 *
 * Locale 2.0 addresses this inventory through
 * `$module.x-formspec-surface.shell.<SurfaceStringKey>`. The adapter at the end
 * of this module binds a target-aware Locale lookup and the host's FEL
 * evaluator to that exact family. The core still owns no locale selection or
 * expression engine.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `ROUTE_CLASS_THEME_REASON` and
 * `UNCLASSIFIED_THEME_REASON` (`theme-authority.ts`). Those answer a different
 * requirement — §4.3.1 makes them keyed *by the route-class vocabulary* so they
 * cannot drift out of sync with it, and that keying is the point of where they
 * live.
